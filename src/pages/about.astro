      <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating efficient, maintainable software 
        using modern technologies. My journey into programming began with curiosity about how 
        things work under the hood, and has evolved into expertise across multiple languages 
        and platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I focus on TypeScript for frontend and backend development, Go for 
        high-performance services, and Rust for systems programming. I'm particularly 
        interested in leveraging AI tools to enhance development workflows and build 
        better software faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to 
        open source projects, or writing about my experiences in software development.

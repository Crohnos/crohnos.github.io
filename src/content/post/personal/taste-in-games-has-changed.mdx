## The Competitive Grind

I've logged thousands of hours in ranked League of Legends. Add to that my time in Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, and countless other competitive multiplayer games. The number would probably shock me if I tallied it all up. For years, these games defined my gaming experience - the rush of climbing ranks, the satisfaction of a perfectly executed team fight, the endless pursuit of that next division.

But here's what those hours really taught me: competitive gaming comes with a hidden cost that goes far beyond time.

## The True Price of Competitive Gaming

The time commitment alone is staggering. A single League match can run 40+ minutes, and that's if someone doesn't dodge in champion select. String together a few games in an evening, and suddenly your entire night is gone. But time is just the surface-level cost.

The real toll is psychological. The culture surrounding competitive multiplayer games is saturated with negativity and pessimism. Every match is a powder keg of potential toxicity. One misplay, one off-meta pick, one lag spike - and the chat explodes. Even victories often feel hollow when they're punctuated by teammates flaming each other.

Over time, this constant exposure to negativity seeps into your general wellbeing. You log off feeling drained rather than refreshed. Gaming becomes a source of stress rather than relief. The hobby that's supposed to be your escape starts feeling like a second job - one with particularly hostile coworkers.

## Discovering What Games Can Really Be

My gaming renaissance began with Outer Wilds. Here was a game that respected my time, stimulated my mind, and actually moved me emotionally. No ranks to climb, no teammates to disappoint, no post-game lobby toxicity. Just pure exploration, discovery, and wonder.

Single-player games offer something competitive multiplayer never could: the ability to pause. To walk away when life calls. To play at your own pace without letting down four other people. They provide genuine relaxation and mental stimulation without the cortisol spike of ranked anxiety.

## Finding Balance Through Fighting Games

Ironically, I recently picked up Street Fighter 6 - another competitive game, but with a crucial difference. My brother is an expert player, and SF6 has become our way of spending time together. The 1v1 format eliminates team toxicity. Matches are quick. And most importantly, it's about connection, not ranking up.

There's something pure about fighting games. Your losses are your own, your victories earned. The community, while competitive, tends toward respect for skill and dedication rather than blind rage at teammates.

## The Indie Revolution

Perhaps my biggest shift has been toward indie games. As a developer myself, I've gained immense appreciation for the craft and nuance required to create these experiences. Solo development projects especially fascinate me - they're pure creative vision, unfiltered by committee decisions or market research.

Indie games dare to be different. They explore unique mechanics, tell unconventional stories, and respect the player's intelligence. They're made by people who love games, for people who love games. There's an authenticity there that's increasingly rare in the AAA space.

## Gaming as Self-Care

My taste in games hasn't just changed - it's matured. I've learned to recognize when a game is adding value to my life versus when it's extracting it. The thousands of hours in League weren't wasted - they taught me what I actually want from gaming:

- **Respect for my time** - Games I can pause, save, and return to on my schedule
- **Positive emotional impact** - Experiences that leave me feeling better, not worse
- **Genuine challenge** - Difficulty that comes from design, not from dealing with toxic players
- **Artistic merit** - Games that have something to say or a unique vision to share

## Moving Forward

I don't regret my competitive gaming years, but I'm glad they're behind me. Gaming is too beautiful a medium to waste on experiences that consistently make you feel worse. Life's too short to spend it being flamed by strangers on the internet.

These days, my Steam library is full of indie gems waiting to be discovered. My PS5 houses single-player epics that I can experience at my own pace. And yes, Street Fighter 6 is there too - a reminder that competitive gaming can still have a place when it's about connection rather than compulsion.

The games haven't changed. I have. And I'm happier for it.

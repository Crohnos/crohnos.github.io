## The Explosion We Can't Ignore

The numbers are stark. ADHD diagnoses have increased dramatically over the past two decades. Autism spectrum diagnoses have followed a similar trajectory. Social media is flooded with neurodivergence content. Everyone seems to know someone recently diagnosed - or is that someone themselves.

This leaves us with an uncomfortable question: Are we witnessing a genuine increase in neurodivergence, better recognition of previously undiagnosed conditions, or a social contagion effect amplified by algorithmic feeds?

The answer matters. And it's not as simple as either camp wants to believe.

## The Case for Genuine Increase

**Better Diagnostic Tools and Awareness**

We're simply better at recognizing neurodivergence now. ADHD in girls was systematically overlooked for decades because it presents differently than in boys. Autism without intellectual disability was barely recognized until recently. Many adults are receiving diagnoses that explain struggles they've had their entire lives.

This isn't over-diagnosis - it's catching up on decades of under-diagnosis.

**Environmental Factors**

Modern life might genuinely be creating more neurodivergent brains. Consider:
- Increased screen time from infancy affecting attention development
- Environmental toxins and pollutants affecting neurological development
- Older parental age correlated with higher autism rates
- The cognitive demands of modern life revealing struggles that agricultural life might have masked

**Survival and Success**

Neurodivergent individuals are surviving and thriving in ways they couldn't historically. Better healthcare means higher survival rates for premature babies (who have higher rates of ADHD). Less physical labor means people who would have struggled in farming communities can succeed in knowledge work. We're not seeing more neurodivergence - we're seeing more neurodivergent people surviving to be counted.

## The Case for Social Contagion

**The TikTok Effect**

Open any social media platform and you'll find countless "signs you might have ADHD" videos. These often list universal human experiences:
- Forgetting where you put your keys
- Getting distracted by your phone
- Struggling to focus on boring tasks
- Feeling restless in meetings

When normal human experiences are pathologized, everyone starts to wonder if they're neurodivergent.

**Identity and Belonging**

Neurodivergence has become, in some circles, an identity marker and community membership card. It offers:
- An explanation for life struggles
- A built-in community of understanding
- Absolution from certain failures or difficulties
- A narrative that reframes weaknesses as differences

This is powerfully attractive, especially for young people searching for identity and belonging.

**The Availability Cascade**

The more we talk about something, the more prevalent it seems. The more prevalent it seems, the more we look for it. The more we look for it, the more we find it. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where increased awareness leads to increased identification, regardless of underlying reality.

## The Messy Middle Truth

Here's what I believe: Both things are true simultaneously.

Yes, we're better at diagnosing neurodivergence, and many people are getting help they've needed for years. AND yes, social media is creating an environment where self-diagnosis based on superficial criteria is rampant.

Yes, modern life might be creating more neurodivergent brains. AND yes, we're also pathologizing normal variations in human cognition and attention.

Yes, neurodivergence is real and life-altering for those who have it. AND yes, it's become a trendy label that some adopt without clinical justification.

## The Real Harm on Both Sides

**The Harm of Denial**

Dismissing the increase as purely social contagion:
- Invalidates genuinely neurodivergent people
- Prevents people from getting needed help
- Perpetuates stigma and misunderstanding
- Ignores real environmental and social factors

**The Harm of Over-Identification**

Treating every quirk as neurodivergence:
- Dilutes resources for those with genuine needs
- Medicalizes normal human variation
- Creates learned helplessness
- Reduces complex individuals to diagnostic labels

## The Nuance Nobody Wants

The internet hates nuance, but here it is anyway:

1. **Neurodivergence is real** - Brain differences exist and profoundly impact lives
2. **Diagnosis has improved** - We're catching cases we missed for decades
3. **Social contagion is also real** - Social media absolutely influences self-perception
4. **Both can coexist** - Someone can be genuinely neurodivergent AND influenced by social narratives
5. **Context matters** - A trait that's disabling in one environment might be neutral or beneficial in another

## Moving Forward Thoughtfully

**If You Think You're Neurodivergent**

- Seek professional evaluation - self-diagnosis has limits
- Look at lifetime patterns, not recent struggles
- Consider other explanations - trauma, stress, and depression can mimic ADHD
- Remember that struggles don't require a diagnosis to be valid

**If You're Skeptical of the Increase**

- Listen to diagnosed individuals' experiences
- Recognize that better diagnosis isn't over-diagnosis
- Understand that invisible disabilities are still disabilities
- Accept that your experience isn't universal

## The Questions That Matter

Instead of debating whether the increase is "real" or "contagion," maybe we should ask:

- How can we help people who are struggling, regardless of diagnosis?
- What environmental factors might be affecting neurological development?
- How can we create spaces that work for different types of minds?
- Why does modern life seem so hostile to human attention and focus?

## The Path Between Extremes

The truth about neurodivergence and social contagion isn't comfortable for anyone. It requires holding multiple truths simultaneously:

Neurodivergence is real AND social media influences self-perception.
Diagnosis has improved AND some people are self-diagnosing incorrectly.
We need to take it seriously AND we need to be thoughtful about labels.
Individual struggles are valid AND not everything is a disorder.

## Looking Forward

The increase in neurodivergence identification - whatever its causes - is telling us something important about modern life. Whether it's revealing previously hidden struggles, creating new ones, or both, it's clear that many people are finding traditional expectations increasingly difficult to meet.

Maybe instead of arguing about whether the increase is "real," we should be asking why so many people are struggling and what we can do about it. The answer to that question matters far more than winning the debate about causation.

The conversation about neurodivergence and social contagion needs less certainty and more curiosity, less judgment and more support, less debate about validity and more focus on helping people thrive - diagnosed or not.

Because in the end, whether someone's struggles come from neurodivergence, social influence, or modern life itself, the struggles are still real. And that's what we should be addressing.
